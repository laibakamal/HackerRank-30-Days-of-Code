//Task
//Complete the code in the editor below. The variables, i, d, and s are already declaredand initialized for you.You must :
//Declare 3 variables : one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
//Read 3 lines of input from stdin(according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
//Use the + operator to perform the following operations :
//Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
//Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
//Concatenate s with the string you read as inputand print the result on a new line.
//Note : If you are using a language that doesn't support using + for string concatenation (e.g.: C), you can just print one variable
//immediately following the other on the same line. The string provided in your editor must be printed first, immediately followed by the string you read as input.

//Input Format
//The first line contains an integer that you must sum with i.
//The second line contains a double that you must sum with d.
//The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with s.

//Output Format
//Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles(scaled to 1 decimal place)
//on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.

//Sample Input
//12
//4.0
//is the best place to learn and practice coding!

//Sample Output
//16
//8.0
//HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!


//Explanation
//When we sum the integers 4 and12, we get the integer 16.
//When we sum the floating - point numbers 4.0 and 4.0, we get 8.0.
//When we concatenate HackerRank with is the best place to learnand practice coding!, 
//we get HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!.
