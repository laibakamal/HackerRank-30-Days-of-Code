//
//Objective
//In this challenge, we're going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance; 
// because this is an Object Oriented concept, it's only enabled in certain languages.Check out 
// the Tutorial tab for learning materialsand an instructional video!


//Task
//Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, 
// as a parameter.The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed 
// as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age  to 0 and 
// print Age is not valid, setting age to 0..In addition, you must write the following instance methods :
//yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
//amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions :
//If age<13 , print You are young..
//If age>=13 and age<18, print You are a teenager..
//Otherwise, print You are old..


//To help you learn by exampleand complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, 
// but you'll be writing everything in the future. The code that creates each instance of your Person 
// class is in the main method. Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!


//The first line contains an integer, (the number of test cases), and the  subsequent lines each contain
//  an integer denoting the  of a Person instance.


//Sample Input
//4
//- 1
//10
//16
//18



//Sample Output
//Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
//You are young.
//You are young.
//
//You are young.
//You are a teenager.
//
//You are a teenager.
//You are old.
//
//You are old.
//You are old.
