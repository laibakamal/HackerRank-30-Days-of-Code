//To solve this challenge, we must first take each character in s, 
//enqueue it in a queue, and also push that same character onto 
//a stack.Once that's done, we must dequeue the first character
//from the queue and pop the top character off the stack, then 
//compare the two characters to see if they are the same; as long
//as the characters match, we continue dequeueing, popping, and 
//comparing each character until our containers are empty (a non-match means  isn't a palindrome).

//Write the following declarations and implementations:
//Two instance variables : one for your stack, and one for your queue.
//A void pushCharacter(char ch) method that pushes a character onto a stack.
//A void enqueueCharacter(char ch) method that enqueues a character in the queue instance variable.
//A char popCharacter() method that popsand returns the character at the top of the stack  instance variable.
//A char dequeueCharacter() method that dequeuesand returns the first character in the queue instance variable.


//Sample Input
//racecar

//Sample Output
//The word, racecar, is a palindrome.
